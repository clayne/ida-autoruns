# IDA Autoruns

IDA-Autoruns is a simple plugin to make a script run automatically
every time you open a specific IDB.

## Usage

1. Install the plugin
1. Set the `EDITOR` variable in the plugin to the desired editor
1. Press `View -> Edit Autoruns` to edit the autoruns script
1. Be sure to save the IDB, as it will store the script


## Drawbacks

While this plugin is useful for small, IDB-specific hacks, I highly
recommend using proper plugins whenever possible.
